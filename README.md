# Mini personal project I used to gather the products from my competitor's website allowing me to import their products to sell alongside my inventory.  

# This allowed me to increase my product catalogue without having to physically hold stock or commit capital to stock.  

# My old website can be seen here using the wayback machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20210805233807/https://www.gearmot.com/ 

# I designed the front end for the website using the shopify liquid programming language.
